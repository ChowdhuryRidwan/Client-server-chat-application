# Client-server-chat-application
Source code for client-server connection in Linux/UNIX systems which has been implemented in C
If your are using one PC:
Open two terminals where one terminal is the client and the other terminal is the server. Compile both the files in
different terminals. To run the server write this on your terminal: ./server_name portnumber. Portnumber can be any four digits.
To run the client and connect it to the server write this on your terminal: ./client_name 127.0.0.1 portnumber. 127.0.0.1 is 
the local host address which is used to connect to the same machine or computer. The portnumber is the same that you have used 
for your server. After connection is established you can send messages to each terminal by typing.
